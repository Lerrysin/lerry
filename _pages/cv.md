Education
======
- Ph.D in Division of Emerging Interdisciplinary Areas (EMIA), HONG KONG University of Science and Technology, 2021-2026(expected)
- B.S. in Information Technology (IT), South China University of Technology, 2015-2019

Research Interests
======
### Haptic Interaction Device and Rendering
- Focus: Flexible haptic devices and rendering techniques for virtual environments.
- Defined clear research problems and scopes; conducted comprehensive literature reviews, including a survey on electrotactile feedback.
- For VR and wearable interaction, designed and implemented flexible, high‑density haptic feedback devices and supporting software. Delivered full‑stack development from hardware to engine integration:
  - Hardware/firmware on ESP32; host‑side control in Python
  - Real‑time integration with Unreal Engine
  - End‑to‑end data flow via WebSocket
  - Built two haptic surfaces—a vibrotactile matrix and a pneumatic actuator array—each resulting in a publication
- Designed and ran psychophysics and usability studies in VR:
  - Behavioral metrics: task accuracy, reaction time, and standardized subjective scales
  - Recognition/discrimination analysis using confusion matrices
  - Statistics for within‑ and between‑subjects designs: repeated‑measures and mixed‑design ANOVA, post‑hoc multiple comparisons, and t‑tests (with normality/homoscedasticity checks and nonparametric alternatives as needed); reported effect sizes and CIs
  - Qualitative insights via thematic analysis (open coding → categorization → theme extraction) to inform iterative design

### Generative AI
- Focus: Leveraging GenAI to deliver personalized virtual environments.
- Implemented pipelines based on Stable Diffusion to generate 3D virtual spaces; built interactive UE projects.
- Designed user studies to evaluate GenAI‑generated, customized virtual spaces; analyzed questionnaire data with descriptive statistics and t‑tests, resulting in a publication.

Entrepreneurship Experience
======
Apr 2023 – Present  
**HONGKONG JUNTIAN TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED | Co‑Founder**
- Conducted systematic market analysis to track emerging trends, customer needs, and competitive dynamics; authored business plans and led competition and grant submissions, securing a seven‑figure HKSTP sponsorship and multiple entrepreneurship awards.
- Led the drafting of the Hong Kong Aerospace White Paper; the work was cited in the Chief Executive’s 2024 Policy Address (p.84, Chapter 4, Sections 83–84: “Advancing Communications Technology” and “Promoting Aerospace R&D”).
- Lead the HKUST's first satellite, raising HKD 15 million in external donations and successfully launching on 26 August 2023.

Work experience
======
2019.9–2021.6  
**DJI | Intermediate Product Engineer**

### Industry and Needs Research
- Conducted a year-long study of the education market and its segments; built end-to-end stakeholder personas and mapped their needs from 0 to 1.
- Contributed to DJI Education’s product, go-to-market strategy and business model (BP), iterating and validating the strategy over time.

### Product Design
- Software Platform: Designed and led development of the DJI Education Platform, owning market research, product design, project management, pricing, and launch. The platform addressed the high cost of S1 hardware, enabling broader participation in the RM education ecosystem and accumulating approximately 100,000 registered users. Independently designed the online competition module and, in partnership with the Hubei and Guizhou Provincial Departments of Education, launched DJI’s first online competition, bringing daily traffic to over 10,000 users at peak.
- Integrated Solutions: Designed DJI Education’s first end-to-end education solution—the AI Scenario-Based Solution—combining hardware, software, curriculum, and competitions for middle and high schools. It helped teachers answer “what to teach” and “how to teach.” The solution’s competition format was eventually adopted as official provincial-level events in nearly 10 provinces.
- S1 (Educational Robot Car) Accessories: Designed and managed accessories such as a charging dock and modular, connectable arenas. The charging dock solved in-store display and uptime needs, enabling the S1 to operate autonomously for 12 hours to enhance product demos. The modular arena supported DIY scenarios, broadening usage and play patterns.
