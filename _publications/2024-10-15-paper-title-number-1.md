Exergaming, blending exercise and gaming, improves the physical and mental health of older adults. We currently do not fully know the factors that drive older adults to either engage in or abstain from exergaming. Large-scale studies investigating this are still scarce, particularly those studying East Asian older adults. To address this, we interviewed 64 older adults from China, Japan, and South Korea about their attitudes toward exergames. Most participants viewed exergames with a positive inquisitiveness. However, socio-cultural factors can obstruct this curiosity. Our study shows that perceptions of aging, lifestyle, the presence of support networks, and the cultural relevance of game mechanics are the crucial factors influencing their exergame engagement. Thus, we stress the value of socio-cultural sensitivity in game design and urge the HCI community to adopt more diverse design practices. We provide several design suggestions for creating more culturally approachable exergames.
