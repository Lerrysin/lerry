Exergaming, the combination of exercise and gaming, has emerged as a compelling avenue to encourage older adults to remain active. However, there is a notable gap in comparative research on older adultsâ€™ perspectives and preferences regarding different exergaming platforms. To address this gap, we conducted a survey with 42 East Asian older adults aged 61 to 75 years from China, Japan, and South Korea, aimed at understanding the factors that influence their preferences for Virtual Reality (VR), Exercube, and 2D Exergames. The survey collected initial data on their perspectives, which we then explored in depth through 20 follow-up interviews. Our findings revealed a distinct preference for 2D games, particularly mobile apps, which the older participants found safer, more accessible, cost-effective, and conducive to social engagement. The findings from this study highlight the key factors that are significant to older adults when selecting exergame platforms and point toward future research directions that could improve the desirability and uptake of these interactive technologies for an aging population.
